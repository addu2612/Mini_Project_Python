# Premier League Analysis (2006-07 to 2017-18)

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing two datasets, namely 'results' and 'stats,' covering the Premier League seasons from 2006-07 to 2017-18. The primary objective is to gain insights into team performance, statistics, and notable achievements during this period.

## Tools Used

- **Pandas:** Employed for data manipulation tasks, such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data, facilitating a detailed analysis.

- **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and array manipulations, providing a foundation for efficient data processing.

- **Matplotlib:** Used for creating visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends, including team performance, goal statistics, and other relevant metrics.

## Focus on the 2007-08 Season

The analysis places a particular emphasis on the 2007-08 season. This season was chosen due to the noteworthy achievement of my favorite team winning the double (both the Premier League and Champions League).

## Key Steps

1. **Data Import:**
   - Imported 'results' and 'stats' datasets in CSV format.
   - Utilized Pandas to create DataFrames for easy data manipulation.

2. **2007-08 Season Analysis:**
   - Filtered data to focus specifically on the 2007-08 season.

3. **Pandas Analysis:**
   - Utilized Pandas for in-depth data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, and aggregation.

4. **Data Processing with NumPy:**
   - Utilized NumPy for numerical operations and array manipulations, enhancing efficiency in data processing.

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Leveraged Matplotlib to create informative visualizations highlighting key aspects of the Premier League data.
